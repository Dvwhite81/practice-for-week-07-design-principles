# Design Notes

Instagram:
Lots of white space
Flat design
Aesthetics - all black and white

I like the simplicity, but seems a little too simple. It works on a smaller screen, but full screen on a computer looks pretty boring. Also, when only half-screen clicking on comments doesn't show them for me. Big dislike on that.

Craigslist:
Lots of white space
Flat design
Aesthetics - all black and white with blue text

I don't like it at all. The main page shows all categories and sub-categories, which is nice, but looks like a wall of text. The categories are the same thing. To me, it looks pretty amateurish and boring. I guess it serves its purpose.

Reddit:
White space but not too much
Flat design
Aesthetics - Mostly black and white, with shades of red on buttons

I like it. It shows posts and not just text. Easy to navigate with menus. Simple but well-designed. My favorite so far.

Paul Graham:
Lots of white space
Mostly flat design
Aesthetics - Mostly white with shade of purple on buttons and links

Okay for what it is. Really simple, but also looks amateurish. The buttons look outdated, overall the whole thing looks outdated. I like the faint heading "Paul Graham", and wish there were more subtle things like that.
